# Scrabble Solver

### About
A scrabble solver, which reads the current game board using OCR and produces the highest scoring move.

### Try it Yourself!

1. Open the `/examples/` folder.
2. Run the example script using your IDE of choice, or from terminal with `python3 example.py --gametype <choose either scrabble or wwf> --file <path to image>`. If you don't have an image, simply omit that argument and the program will use the array with letters that is in the example file. There is also a sample image in the directory, if you'd like to try out the OCR.

Here's how it should look:

### How it Works

#### Reading the Board
1) OpenCV is used to apply several filters to the input image in to make it as machine-readable as possible.
2) Then each tile from the game board is split, and duplicated 10x in a row.
3) Pytesseract is then used to read the letters, and the most common letter from the 10 is selected.
4) The output from the OCR is stored as a list of letters which is used to create a Board object.

#### Calculating the Best Move
Generating all of the move is a 4 step process. Initial inspiration, along with the idea of reducing the move generation to a 1-Dimensional problem is taken from a publication by Appel & Jacobson, which is cited below.

1. A new word in scrabble can only be placed connecting to an existing word. As a result, the program initially goes through the board recording all of these locations in the Tile object, by updating the property `isAnchor`.
2. The program next goes through the board, and checks each empty location on the board, to see if any of the tiles can be placed there. All allowable tiles are placed into the "allowed" list of that location. 
3. With the allowed letters, the program then steps through each anchor tile, and compiles a list of each possible left part of a word, prior to the anchor point. Each left part can be made from either existing tiles on the board, or tiles from the hand. 
4. Finally possible moves are generated by going through each left part, and then extended to the right, using the allowed letters and any letters it runs into. If any moves do not form valid words, they are rejected.

As this process is solely 1-D (it only searchs for moves made horizontally) this process is repeated for the transposed board. Each move generated is then scored, and the highest scoring move is returned.
